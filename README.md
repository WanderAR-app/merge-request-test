# Merge Request Example

A merge request is a way to propose changes to a codebase that is managed using a version control system like Git. It allows developers to collaborate on a project by suggesting changes to the codebase and having those changes reviewed and approved by other members of the team.

When creating a merge request, it's important to provide a clear description of the changes being proposed and any relevant context or background information. This helps reviewers understand the purpose and scope of the changes and make informed decisions about whether to approve or reject the request.

Additionally, it's important to follow any guidelines or best practices established by the team or organization for creating and submitting merge requests. This can help ensure that the review process is efficient and effective, and that the codebase remains stable and maintainable over time.
